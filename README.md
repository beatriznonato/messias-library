# Messias Library üìö

## Challenge Description

Develop robust business management software for micro and small businesses.
The aim of the software is to provide a solution for the efficient management of library books and loans. Users will be able to create, read, update and delete book and loan records.
The software's data should be stored in a database to facilitate data integrity and enable efficient information retrieval.
The software must contain a registration page with password encryption to protect user accounts and personal information and guarantee data security. Access to the software is granted via a login page. 

## User Story üë•

As a user **librarian**:
- I can add new books to the library by providing their relevant details, including 
*ISBN*, *title*, *author*, *genre*, *publisher*, *price*, *number of books available* and *edition*.
- I can update the book records whenever necessary.
- I can see clearly and intuitively all the books available in the inventory.
- I can remove books that are no longer available or are considered unsuitable from the library software.
- I can make loans of books from the library's inventory, with the ability to enter essential information such as *book ISBN*, customer data such as *name*, *email*, *phone number* and *address*, *loan date* and *loan duration*.
- I can access a clear and intuitive interface to keep track of all my loans.
- I can mark loans as "returned" to keep complete track of the library's loans.

As a user **admin**:
- I can create accounts for employees, creating credentials to access the library's management resources.

As a user **owner**:
- I prioritize the secure storage of employee passwords in the system, using robust *encryption* algorithms to protect confidential information.


## Technologies üñ•

*  Java version 20 or later
*  [BCrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) version 0.4.3
*  **ojdbc.jar dependency** for Oracle database connection

## How to Install ‚öôÔ∏è 

To install in developer mode, follow the step-by-step:

1. Clone the repository on your computer
    
    ```sh
    $ git clone <repository_url>
    ```
    
2. Access the directory where you downloaded this project and run the [SQL Script](#sql-script) to create the necessary tables in the database

Note: If you decide to rename the tables or attributes, be sure to update the corresponding SQL script in the *BookSaleDAO.java*, *UserLoginDAO.java* and *RentalDAO.java* files located in the dao package inside the src folder. This ensures that the software reflects the renamed information accurately.

3. Configure database connection details. Open the **DBManager.java** file located in the dao package inside the src folder. Replace the existing code with your own database connection details.
    
    
 ```
     connection = DriverManager.getConnection("url", "username", "password");
 ```

## SQL Script üñ•
Run the **SQL script** to create the required tables and attributes in your database.

```sql
-- Table: T_PBL_USERLOGIN
CREATE TABLE T_PBL_USERLOGIN ( 
ID_USERLOGIN NUMBER(10) NOT NULL, 
NM_USERNAME VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL, 
DS_PASSWORD VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL, 
TEMP_PASSWORD NUMBER(2,0) NOT NULL,
IS_ADMIN CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT PK_USERLOGIN PRIMARY KEY (ID_USERLOGIN), 
CONSTRAINT UQ_USERLOGIN_USERNAME UNIQUE (NM_USERNAME)
);

INSERT INTO T_PBL_USERLOGIN (ID_USERLOGIN, NM_USERNAME, DS_PASSWORD) VALUES ('999', 'firstUser', '1234');

-- Table: T_PBL_ORDER_BOOK
CREATE TABLE T_PBL_ORDER_BOOK (
ID_ORDER_BK NUMBER(10) NOT NULL,
CD_ORDER_ISBN NUMBER(13,0) NOT NULL,
NM_ORDER_TITLE VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
DS_GENRE VARCHAR2(30) NOT NULL,
DS_PUBLISHER VARCHAR2(30) NOT NULL,
VL_SALE NUMBER(5,2) NOT NULL,
QT_ORDER_AVAILABLE NUMBER(3,0) NOT NULL,
NM_AUTHOR VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
DS_EDITION NUMBER(2,0),
CONSTRAINT PK_ORDER_BOOK PRIMARY KEY (ID_ORDER_BK)
);

-- Table: T_PBL_RENTAL
CREATE TABLE T_PBL_RENTAL (
ID_RENTAL NUMBER NOT NULL,
ISBN_BOOK NUMBER NOT NULL, 
DT_RENTAL DATE NOT NULL, 
DS_RENTAL_DURATION NUMBER NOT NULL, 
DS_RENTAL_PRICE NUMBER(5,2) NOT NULL, 
NM_CLIENT VARCHAR2(50 BYTE) NOT NULL, 
DS_EMAIL VARCHAR2(50 BYTE) NOT NULL, 
NR_PHONE NUMBER(11,0) NOT NULL, 
NM_STREET VARCHAR2(50 BYTE) NOT NULL, 
NR_HOUSE VARCHAR2(5 BYTE) NOT NULL, 
NR_CEP NUMBER(8,0) NOT NULL,
NM_DISTRIC VARCHAR2(30 BYTE) NOT NULL, 
NM_CITY VARCHAR2(30 BYTE) NOT NULL, 
NM_STATE VARCHAR2(20 BYTE) NOT NULL, 
DT_RETURN DATE NOT NULL,
CONSTRAINT PK_RENTAL PRIMARY KEY (ID_RENTAL) 
);
```

## How to Run üïπ

1. Export the project as an **executable .jar file** and designate `LoginPage.java` as the startup page.
2. Open your command line interpreter and run the following code to start the application:

 ```
    java -jar fileName.jar
 ```
 
Note: make sure you navigate to the directory where the file is saved and replace `"fileName"` with the actual name of the file.
3. For the first login to the software, use the username and password generic. For security reasons, you must create a new username and password after your first login.

 ```
    username: firstUser
    password: 1234
 ```
 
## Features ‚ú®
Features already available in the software:

* **Inventory management**: Users can easily add new books to the system, modify existing book information, review the complete book inventory and remove specific books from the system when necessary.
* **Loan management**: The system makes it possible to generate loans for books that are available in stock, and makes it possible to manage all current loans via a complete dashboard.
* **Login page**: Provides a secure gateway for registered users to access their accounts. It employs the [BCrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) algorithm to compare and verify passwords, increasing the overall security of the login process and data storage.
* **Login management**: Enables users who have administrator-level access to create new logins for new employees. These employees can have librarian or administrator access types.

## Q&A‚ùì
**1. How can I reset my password if I forget it??**

The password recovery feature isn't available yet but will be released in the next version of the software. It is recommended that you create a new account.


**2. When I mark a loan as returned, can I access the loan data?**

Unfortunately not. Once a loan is marked as returned, you will no longer have access to the loan data in question.
